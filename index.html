    <p>Dr. M. Mohan Babu’s keen interest towards learning and academics comes from his father, Narayana Swamy Naidu, a teacher and headmaster in a school in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. Dr. M. Mohan Babu set up SVET as a hub of knowledge and academic excellence. People of all nations, races, beliefs, social strata or academic background are welcome. What once started off as an institution with 216 students, it has risen to be an institution with close to 10000 students, 5 colleges and two schools. The trust’s institutions have a cumulative full-time faculty of over 350, initially starting off as 10. SVET is the largest private institution in the Rayalaseema region and operates in collaboration with the Governments of India and Andhra Pradesh.
